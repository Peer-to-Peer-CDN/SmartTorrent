# Overview
The goal of the project is to create an onchain voting application. Since this is a school project, it is only a software draft with limited functionality. For a productive operation, further development and extensive testing would be necessary.\
Required components ([detailed requirements](https://dsl.i.ost.ch/lect/hs22#challenge-task-hs-2022)):
- Simple frontend (triggers onchain voting and display the results)
- Contract for onchain voting
- Second contract which processes the voting result
