# BlCh-Challenge-Task

Blockchain Challenge Task: Adrian Locher & Jason Benz

Challenge Task HS 2022
This semester's challenge task (CT) is the design and implementation of an onchain voting application. Ideally, the application is a decentralized application (DApp).

Find use-case or idea for your app
- [ ] Your app must include a simple frontend (e.g., HTML, Vue, React, Svelte, ...)
- [ ] Your app must include a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, ...)

## Requirements
All requirements below must be met in order to pass this lecture.

- [ ] A working prototype for your use-case
- [ ] Use latest stable releases of chosen libraries and frameworks
- [ ] Submission of a voting proposal, with previously known consequences and recipients (can be testnet)
- [ ] Onchain voting on proposal with at least 2 participants / identities (can be testnet)
- [ ] Successful vote needs to trigger something onchain. Can be an ERC20 or an NFT transfer (can be testnet)
- [ ] Voting status and process need to be shown in the frontend
- [ ] The solution may use existing libraries and code, but those must open software software
